# 22Buttons
In 2014, I think, I wired up a teensy microcontroller to some buttons on some perfboard, and wrote some code to send character to a terminal on my computer over usb. It worked, and was very educational, but it wasn't very useful.

This repo also contains code from some other sources, such as PJRC.
